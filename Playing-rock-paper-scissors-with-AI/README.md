# Playing Rock, Paper, Scissors with AI

This repository contains the notebook for "Playing Rock, Paper, Scissors with AI" Tutorial

You can access the Tutorial for this [here](https://www.learnopencv.com/playing-rock-paper-scissors-with-ai/).

[Playing Rock, Paper, Scissors with AI](Rock_paper_scissor.ipynb)

You can download the rps3.h5 model from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZAEhMXlAxDkVbVo-1DE2aO_YphDscJLD/view?usp=sharing), although I would strongly suggest to train your own model on your own hands.
